The Phoenix Of Antarctica 

The Creation

     The story begins in the large continent of Asia, the time is 9975 BC. 
The population is divided into many small villages and a big city or a big town surrounds with suburbs from time to time.

     It was the 7th day of the week, outside a hut built on tall trees in a small village. In the darkness of the night a loud scream sound and an echo followed it. Then some more screams of pain while a group of people gathered around that tree on the ground, all of them are silent, waiting. Most of them carried torches to light their surroundings. 

     High above from the ground, above the 7th sky, floating in the air, not influenced by the gravity force, floated the Temple of Clouds - the domestic place of the elder gods. In the center of the temple, lies the Hall of the Beholders. It was a neutral territory of the temple for any god to walk, be represented and represent his interests. The beholders there served the gods and they had the ability to focus their sight on any spot around the globe and show it on the orb of earth. The beholder is a half human height and he has one giant eye and arms – tentacles-like with eye at the end of each and he usually floats. 

     The head of the gods entered the hall, and asked: “Who has summoned me here, today, now?” One of the gods approached to the head of the gods and spoke: “I, Partogmidis, the god of health…” (He had a white beholder and a white robe) “…Have called you, the great Corecelltor to observe in the arrival of pure soul into the living world of those mortals.” Corecelltor said: “I’ll watch carefully now in order to verify that the soul is pure of evil.” 

     Down in the village the people were still silent and waiting. More and more screams were heard for an hour. After an hour the screams stopped, a hit sound, and then a man ran out of the hut carrying a blanket, and he cried:” Morvaldo has delivered my baby, my baby!!” he shouted very excitedly and the crowd was overjoyed for a minute. Then one of the older farmers asked: “What's his name?” 

     The crowd silenced waiting for the answer for so simple question. The man said slowly, "Hmm… his… his name is…"

     (Up there in the clouds) Corecelltor whispered "…Puritarus…" 

     (Down in the village) The man said loudly again, almost shouting "Puritarus!!!" and then all the crowd became noisy again and started a big celebration for the baby that was just born. 

     The man returned the baby to his wife. The obstetrician, who was the village witchdoctor, came to the man and said: "Very good, you made everyone happy again Chorgane, and you chose a nice name to the baby." Chorgane said to Morvaldo: "I want to thank you for your good work, but later. I don't know how I chose this name; somehow it was blinking in my mind, strange isn't it?" 

     Morvaldo answered him: "Yes and now please leave Sheyrad to rest and later breastfeed Puritarus, so go now to spread your joy in the celebration." 

     Chorgane left the hut of the witchdoctor and got down from the high tree by the ladder – step by step, put a foot on the ground and then another and… (Oh, not too much small details). 

     Up in the Temple of Clouds, in the Hall of the Beholders, a cold breeze was blown by the dark god of darkness, towards Corecelltor. Corecelltor asked: "What happened, Intimiditors?" A dark figure appeared; he had a black robe with a stripe of blood on his back. The light in the room was rejected slightly from his location.

     He said: "A pure soul was created – is it true?" 
Corecelltor replied: "A new age for that race will begin shortly – like it should be."
     Intimiditors asked: "Which race is the lucky one – the orcish race, the gnomish race, or perhaps it is the dragons' race?"
     "It is the humans' race." Corecelltor answered
     "Young are you. How old exactly?" Intimiditors said
     Corecelltor replied: "Only 2048 moon years. Why?"
     Intimiditors said: "You are blind to the consequences. The balance may collapse but you will serve blindly your side in the great conflict."
     "Innocent face you pretend Intimiditors…" Partogmidis interfered "…three pure evil souls exist there on the ground (mostly). A half orcish half goblin death knight is one of your pure evil souls and there's a dragon, and someone else. You have no right to complain about one pure soul that will only balance the equilibrium of the great conflict."

     Intimiditors looked behind and called three other gods: "Flamenor, Landaturos, and Lin-Aris come with me, now, to the Drekkor chambers to discuss something about the near future."

     A water-made creature entered the hall and was followed by a blue beholder. He greeted all the gods that were present but he saw Intimiditors and his trusted gods following him to their side of the temple.
     Corecelltor said: "Greetings to you too, Hydrotilis." 
     Hydrotilis asked: "Have I missed anything?"
     "The same old story, on the great balance of souls." Corecelltor answered.

     Tomorrow morning Landaturos, who was looking very strong, probably because his arms and body was made of rocks and stones, and Flamenor, which was made of fire and flames, left the temple. Landaturos created with a simple magic, using blue mana, a piece of rock in the size of a big hut, then he moved back to Flamenor and said: "My part is over for now; you should reach your destination in an hour or so, my friend, so good luck in your mission and farewell." 
     "Thank you, farewell… Oh and be careful of my fire while I'm launching this stone."
     "It's a rock!!!" Landaturos cried.
     "Whatever… farewell god of land and rocks!"
Landaturos pounded the rock and Flamenor ignited the rock and it burnt down on its way to a mysterious isle. After an hour, which in it the rock disintegrated completely, Flamenor reached some isle isolated from any continent by the great ocean. He burned down some tall trees and made himself comfort. 

     By nightfall he woke up and started to go into the volcano in the center of the island. When he reached there he found great caves near the mountain side. He yelled for a while and made a lot of noise for some moments. Then he felt the ground was moving, almost as it was shivering from the fear of the creatures that lived there. A lot of big, strong, powerful yet beautiful creatures got out of the caves, some of them were green, some white, some yellow, some red and some blue creatures, but they all had something in common, they were all dragons. 

     Flamenor said loudly: "Greetings for all of you, great dragons from Intimiditors and me, Flamenor."
     One quite big green dragon approached to Flamenor and said: "Greetings Flamenor… as you can see, my dear friend, we dragons appreciate your gift of fire but not all of us like you, so you see, you are not welcome to this island anymore."
     Another green-yellow dragon came by her and said: "Denora, you should leave our god Flamenor in peace, he done nothing wrong except burning trees, rabbits, snakes, small birds, one big wounded eagle and some other creatures. So except our gifts and presents in the burned temple of him, he can expect nothing from our family Denora… Come on, let's go back to sleep."

     Flamenor that felt slightly offended by the honour he got from them said in a mean voice: "Denora, Root-Horse, and the lovely son Fire-Hill… What a nice, happy family – you wouldn't want me to build here an orphanage as well, would you?" 

     Root-Horse came back and blew his strongest blow of fire on Flamenor.
     Flamenor seemed unhurt by this and then he said: "Take this ungrateful dragon!!!" He took some cubes of green mana, chanted some words and a huge fireball emerged out of Flamenor hands and stroked Root-Horse.
     Root-Horse laughed a bit and then hit the ground. Denora and Fire-Hill and some other green dragons took Root-Horse to a near small pool of water and tried to heal him.

     Flamenor said: "He's not dead, hopefully not. Don't you all try to burn me for the reason that I'm invulnerable to fire. Now stand still because I'm searching one special soul amongst you." He went to the den of the red dragons and searched for the soul, but he was unable to find her in the red ones. Then he moved over to the lair of the blue ones, and after a while his soul-torch was lighted while he searched their cave. He found a sleeping, huge, strong beast which was mostly blue and it had some red stripes on it and some green, yellow and white circle shaped scarves.

     Flamenor woke the creature and asked him his name. The dragon said: "Forkored, my dear god Flamenor."
     "I need your help, Forkored, for a special mission, which will help me to serve my lord and master, Intimiditors."
     "When my help is needed, Flamenor?"
     "In the next moon year, my friend." Flamenor said.
     "What will I get in return for my help?"
     "The right to enter the 4th sky and the right to shut up your greedy mouth."
     "I want magic, Flamenor, something worthy."
     "You'll get it when the work is done by me, I promise."
     Forkored asked Flamenor: "This job is important to you and our master, Intimiditors, right?"
     "You don't have to say our master, since I know your soul will never allow to anyone to be its master, because of your soul's strength, and yes this is a very important mission for my master." Flamenor answered.
     "If the mission will be a success, then I want that a statue of me in my real size will be built and put by your own statue in your temple's garden in the city of Mino-To-Kochang, the capital of the land over this island to north-east."
     "I'll see what can I do about your demand Forkored, but remember our deal – I'll need your services in the next moon year so don't hurt yourself from now on, so farewell, Forkored." 

     Flamenor went in the dark forest of the island, using the flame of his body to light him the way. He went to his temple and found enough green mana cubes in his burnt temple. He looked suspiciously to the left and to the right but saw nothing in the darkness of the night that surrounded him. He broke some cubes in his hands, chanted some words and teleported himself using the teleport spell back to the Drekkor chambers in the Temple of Clouds.

     From the darkness and still inside that darkness two creatures approached the burnt temple and went into the last location of Flamenor. One of them knelt down to the ground and sniffed it for a moment.
     "He used green mana to teleport himself from his temple, probably back to his chamber." Said the creature who sniffed the ground.
     "That's not unusual for him you know, and many other magic-users use this magic when their destination is far away." Said the other one.
     "He's unlike the other magic-users, but why was he here? What he was searching for? We need to investigate this. It would probably get stinkier if this business of him is serious. Come on we should report this to the others." They left the temple's territory and went on to their destination.

* * *

     A week after Puritarus birth, a hunter came to the village with four companions. He searched the trees, and asked some people for directions. In the center of the village there were two high trees. He checked the labels of each tree, and saw that the tree in the southern side had the label of the address he was seeking for. He climbed the tree by its ladder, without his fellow travelers. When he got to the top of that tree he was standing on a wooden platform in front of the entrance for a wooden hut. He looked on the landscape that surrounded him for a moment, then with a happy glance to his followers, he drew his sword, and told his friends that everything is going to be alright. He started to scratch the platform for a moment, then he carved something.

     The man in the house told his wife to put the baby in his cradle. He said to his wife: "I can hear a scratch on the porch, probably with a blade of a sword." 
     She asked him if he was sure about what he heard, and he nodded with his head while he took his knife and sword. He said to himself but loud enough to be heard: "I'll kill this dwarf, if it's him again…"
     Then he heard the voice of the hunter calling him from outside the hut: "Why don't you show me your face, huh, the great warrior, Chorgane of Tenkai. You know that you have something that I want."
     Chorgane cried out loud: "Is that you, Jayko?" Chorgane took Sheyrad like a prisoner and whispered something in her ear. They got outside to the porch and Chorgane asked Jayko: "Is that what you want?" He indicated towards Sheyrad. Jayko nodded with his head for a positive response.
     Sheyrad cried for help from Jayko: "Jayko, take me with you, because he's gone mad and crazy…"
     Chorgane asked him: "What have you got to give me in exchange?"
     "Probably nothing…" He answered.
     Chorgane put down his knife, and said: "Okay, take her." Then he entered his hut, and shut the door aloud. After that he came out to really greet Jayko: "Greetings Jayko, so what brought you here, my friend?"
     "My legs carried me here and my will power has caused them to do so. Sheyrad, what happened to you? You look a little bit different."
     "Oh yeah? Haven't you ever seen a woman with an after-birth effects?"
     "Well, not really… Say what? You two have a baby, since when?" He asked with enthusiasm.
     "Since a week ago, what – the rumours haven't spread up to you already?" Chorgane asked.
     "No kidding, huh?" Jayko asked them. They both shook their head for a negative response.
     A slight pause followed. They looked at Jayko for a moment, his hair covered his left eye for a second by the wind and then was blown away.
"Are you extending your hair, Jayko?" Sheyrad asked calmly, "It looks very nice."
     "Thanks." Jayko replied while he was about to sheath his sword back to its scabbard, at that moment Chorgane asked him: "Let me have a look on your sword for a moment." 
Jayko gave him the sword gently.
     "What a lovely piece of metal…" Sheyrad said in an annoying voice, almost too childish for a mother.
     "Oh, shut up…" Chorgane told her while he was enjoying himself by examining the sword from every possible angle. "Why did you handed me the sword so gently, not a drop of blood all over it, you big sissy."
     Sheyrad said to Jayko: "Way to go, Jayko."
     Jayko took the sword a bit angrily, and asked Chorgane: "Have you ever met anyone who can clean his sword any better then me," He laughed and Sheyrad gave him a little punch in the shoulder, "…Just kidding with you, Sheyrad, don't take it so hard. I just bought it in the blacksmith of the capital city. You got any food Chorgane?"
     "No, but she can cook if we find any." Jayko wanted to say something but he couldn't open his mouth before they all heard a happy voice calling Jayko: "Jayko, why don't you invite us to the party?"
     "It's not a party, it's a big celebration what's going there." Another voice claimed.
     "If you're not inviting us, Jayko, to your party, then we gonna leave you here and go to the local 'stinking' inn." The first voice stated.
     Sheyrad asked: "Who's there?"
     "Just a bunch of my friends…" Jayko answered.
     No response from them.
     "They got food…" Jayko mentioned.
     On the minute the couple heard that, they looked at each other and then Chorgane said: "How rude of us, tell them to come in, my dear boy."
     "Have you hunted something?" Sheyrad asked.
     "Yep." Jayko replied.
     Then she said in a funny voice: "You kill it, I'll cook it." They all laughed for a second. She wanted to go to the hut but she turned around and said to Chorgane: "You got lucky that I love to cook, Chorgane, because if I didn't you would have to do it yourself." 
     Chorgane said to her commandingly: "Go to the kitchen, where you belong, woman!!!" She entered the hut, and slammed the door harshly.
Jayko said in a high voice to Chorgane: "You pig!!!" and they sniggered. Then he approached the ladder and to the edge of the platform and called his companions, that were about to leave this place. They all came up one by one, each one of them had a more simple armour than Jayko's armour and carried luggage on their backs. After they all climbed up the ladder, they stood in front of Chorgane. 
     A dwarf sent his arm to shake the hand of Chorgane and asked: "Do you remember me Chorgane? The name is Razelot."
     "Yes, I do, we fought back to back against five orcish guards armed well, when we tried to escape their prison, three years ago, in Lord Raymond's castle." Chorgane replied.
     Razelot said proudly to the others: "I killed two of them with my axe, and Chorgane killed the last three with his great sword."
     "We should go and eat now, my friends." Chorgane claimed, he was about to turn around to the door but Jayko told him to wait for a brief moment. 
     He opened his backpack and took out two sealed scrolls, gave them to the Kender beside him and told him: "You wanted to hand those letters to Chorgane yourself, didn't you Dartoff?"
     The kender took the letters very quickly from Jayko and gave them both to Chorgane, and he said: "Allow me to introduce myself, I am Dartoff, one of the best kender-rouges in the business. I feel that a great honour was bestowed upon me to meet you, the great warrior, Chorgane…"
     "Thank you. Now Bartak," He indicated the human warrior, "and Rakash" He indicated to the elf that was with them, "Help Jayko, Razelot and Dartoff to bring the meat into the kitchen where my wife, Sheyrad will cook and make a fine lunch for us." 
     They all entered the big hut on that tall tree, when it was noon time. After they came inside Jayko told Chorgane: "The kender may steal from you here and there because of his thief-like nature, but he is also good in his heart, so I will make him return everything that he may choose to take." 
     Chorgane agreed to tolerate Dartoff's possibility of occurrence actions, or in his own words: "My stuff or your heart on a plate…"
     A little while after they finished eating they began to tell stories to each other. Some of the stories they used to tell were interesting to be heard  but that wasn't the case in that particular day. The boring stories they told were good to be heard because they had a talent for story telling. 
Bartak were talking now: "… and after returning all the gold that our knucklehead kender stole from the cyclop, the idiot tried to offer him a pair of glasses, he almost crushed us, but then Jayko reminded him that we were the ones who set him free in the first place."
     "From who?" Chorgane inquired.
     "From his handcuffs that his old master put on him." Was the answer.
     "Why was he handcuffed for in the first place?" Sheyrad asked.
     "The cyclop himself didn't remember because it was so long ago." Bartak replied. 
     "He probably wanted to keep on it as a secret, just for himself." Added Razelot.
     "Probably…" Said Jayko. "Where's your baby?" He asked Chorgane.
     "There sleeping." He pointed to the right of the room, where in a corner stood a wooden crib. 
     "He's not sleeping." Jayko mentioned.
     "What?" asked Sheyrad a bit surprisingly. 
     "Yes, the cute one is smiling towards me, don't kill me but I didn't catch his name…"
     "That's because you didn't bother to ask." Sheyrad said angrily.
     "Puritarus." Chorgane said while he played with his sword.
Jayko got up from his chair, went to the crib and stared for a minute at Puritarus. Puritarus was looking mostly on Jayko.
     "Let me take him for a little guided tour here on the porch."
     "You can take him, but take care that if anything happens to him, I'll dig your grave tomorrow." Chorgane said.
     "Don't worry Chorgane, Sheyrad and all of you." He took Puritarus in a small blanket from the cradle; Puritarus was already wrapped up in that blanket in the crib. Jayko went up to the wooden platform in front of Chorgane and Sheyrad home and looked on the countryside. 
     He raised his left arm and indicated to the south-west direction and told to Puritarus on his right arm: "Hey, look Puritarus, there, in this direction you'll find the grove of Taka. We usually hunt there and bring a good supply of meat to the humans, elves, dwarves, trolls or other tribes. 
     There in the north of Tenkai village – there you'll find fields of horticultural crops. The farmers go there every morning to plant and raise fruits and vegetables and they bring them home after the harvest season which is the spring, of course. 
     Just like the farmers go a little bit north of the village to their fields, some of the human miners go to the north-west through the hills and valleys of Tilla-Jawb to dig up gold in their gold mine. 
     Every twelve moon months, you – the Tenkai villagers, the elves tribe of Talos-Forx and the dwarves and gnomes clan of Gardan meet at the capital city Mino-To-Kochang. In the capital city there's the annual imperial market exchange week. The elves miners bring their mithril, a big, wide load of this very fine metal. Very fine indeed… The dwarves and gnomes carry the cargo of their mined coal. As you might have guessed on your own, they extract it on their coal mine. 
     In the fair you can find new gnomish inventions which are basically good, but they usually missing something that they didn't think of it, so they're almost never perfect. In that week of all this noise of farmers, blacksmiths, and miners most of the sorcerers meet for a special council.
     This is usually a very secret meeting and the sorcerers and wizards are accompanied by companions such as body guards or mercenaries.
You should know, Puritarus, that a mercenary will first save himself, than his money, and than you come to his priority level unless he's a good man which really needs money. You might want to settle down, Puritarus, for your mother's sake, and be a farmer or a blacksmith or a miner…" He paused for an instant, sighed quietly and continued: "…Not an adventurer like me or a great warrior like your crazy father Chorgane that can burry me alive if I won't 'like' Sheyrad's cooking or artistic creations. A good word to be said about your mother is that she's the best mother you can have: she's carrying about you; she's warm and beautiful and loves you and your father. Although she tries her best, she's not the best cook or artist in this world. I didn't cover you with this blanket, it was your mother. Damn, I like this woman, but don't tell her all this things because of your father. I should be quiet already, Puritarus, it will be getting dark soon. 
     Tomorrow you will go in any direction you like and I'll continue to the next 'stinking' inn, that I'll find in the next village or town. Don't worry, everything I showed you today you will learn from your father later. Come now, Puritarus, let's go inside your home right now." Jayko returned with Puritarus to the hut.
     In midnight all the gang was sleeping already in the guest room floor – fifty percent of them were snoring quite heavily. Chorgane said good night to his only son and took a small lantern from the table. He lit it up, picked up the scrolls which he received earlier. He sat up near Sheyrad who was sitting in the bed. She was holding her arms around her knees, and she was staring to the sky and stars. After reading the two letters, Chorgane tried to call Sheyrad: "Sheyrad…" No response "…hey darling…" Still frozen "Yo, Mrs. Sheyrad who loves to throw her husband to the trash and marry Jayko instead…"
     She finally responded: "Oh, did you say anything; I wasn't in my maximum focus." 
     Chorgane almost fell from his chair. After he recovered from his quiet laughter – so not to wake the others he told her: "Sheyrad, darling…" Still trying to overcome his laughter "…You were totally out of focus, I think…"
     "So what did you want from me, Chorgane?"
Finally succeeded to recover himself he answered very seriously - this time: "The first letter is from our friend Nockdaros, he said that it is absolutely urgent that I will come to his house in the city of Solatra in three weeks from today. I'll have to go."
     "What about the other letter?"
     "Oh, yeah… I was personally invited to get an important position in Lord Thormax's private army, six months from now." 
     "You know that now me and your son need you the most."
     "I know Sheyrad. Do you remember that I quit the imperial army a year ago although I just got a promotion to command a major division in the imperial guards. I told you that I had enough of this job and its risks, but it was a lie. It was an excuse for being with you, Sheyrad, the woman that I love the most in this world. Now I want to go back to service, and to the battles and adventure, but I'll have to delay or let go on this chance for you and for Puritarus."
     "I love you, Chorgane."
     "I know, I love you too, Sheyrad… So, what were you pondering about earlier when I disturbed you?"
     "About this shining dots in the sky, these stars. Is Corecelltor really living up there? And maybe Windtilis will ever take us there with a very big blow of her winds and storms? Will Partogmidis always help us cure from disease, illness and malady? Can the evil powers be diminished…?"
     "Heavy thought, huh? Maybe we'll reach to the sky and to the stars when we fall into the bottomless abyss?"
     "Never say this, even when you're kidding, especially not in front of your son, who is the most precious creature I ever knew."
     "Okay, Sheyrad, I got your point, so just admit that you're afraid of death…"
     "I do afraid of death, Chorgane, it's my greatest fear, but I feel very safe as long as you're with me… Good night, Chorgane." She kissed him.
     "Good night, Sheyrad… Don't worry, Sheyrad, never worry about a damn thing, my dearest pearl of this ocean." And they both went to sleep – finally.

     The next morning came after the night has passed and the sun rose at dawn. Chorgane woke up and saw that Sheyrad was already missing. He got up, washed his face with water from a bowl next to his window of the hut. He checked for Puritarus in his bed but all he found there was a note – a part of a scroll's leather written by a queer pen.
     The note read: "I took our baby to the 'stinking' inn, I wanted to talk with the bartender's wife. Don't you worry about me or Puritarus, ok? Farewell then… Sheyrad."
     He took off his night gown and put civilian clothes, then he inserted small daggers to his shoes, put them on. After that he wore his scabbard and went out. He got of his tree by the ladder and went to the northern tree, and climbed up its ladder. The door was widely open, generally it used to be open in these hours of the day, so Chorgane entered the hut.
     He saw there Morvaldo sitting near his table concocting and mixing potions from different colours into a medium size bottle – a flask who mostly used for health potions. "What are you doing there?" Chorgane asked Morvaldo.
     "I can ask you the same question, right?" He replied.
     "But I asked you first."
     "Then I shall answer you first. I'm making a boom potion."
     "I like your elvish attitude. What's it good for?"
     "First calling me selfish…" The elven-witchdoctor smiled towards Chorgane and he smiled back "… Well it suppose to be explosive but for defensive purposes."
     "It will be used for offensive purposes in the wrong hands. Don't volunteer me for testing it. I got enough worries on my head right now without risking my life on some unnecessary experiment. Anyway, I'm going on a journey to Solatra to meet Nockdaros the wizard."
     "Well I know him, but how can I help you?"
     "I'll need health potions."
     "I got only three for sale, give me fifty gold coins and you can take all the three for the price of two potions."
     "No problem." He put out of his belt a small sack of gold coins. "Fifty gold coins exactly." Morvaldo took the payment and gave Chorgane three glass flasks of health potion. "Do you have some blue and green mana cubes left, Morvaldo?"
     "Only one cube of blue mana. I sold the rest to Talas, our merchant gone looking for wizards now, and in less than two weeks his wife, Velra, is going to deliver a baby."
     "It's about time, you can keep that cube for yourself."
     "Nonsense you may come to need it in battle. Take it away from me, free of charge." 
     "Okay, if you insist. Do you want to go to the market place to buy some accessories and other essential stuff. You can help me choose what I need, know if I'm doing a good bargain and so on."
     "No problem, anything for you, Chorgane."
     "We'll need to pass through the 'stinking' inn to buy some supplies for the nights and take our horses, and I'll get a chance of seeing Sheyrad and Puritarus on the way to the 'stinking' inn or inside it."
     "Alright, wait for me down on the ground and I'll come after I take my stuff and lock the door."
     "Fine, I'll be waiting down." Chorgane left the hut and went down. Morvaldo took his staff and his small dagger inserted to his belt of the light robe he wore. Off they went to the 'stinking' inn.

     After an hour or so they reached to the 'stinking' inn, and got inside. There they saw their former gang: Razelot and Bartak behind the deck getting drunker and drunker, Jayko talking to an old man, and Dartoff picking pockets and money bags from belts of drunkard people in the inn, and Rakash was sitting alone in front of the deck staring at his wine glass.
Chorgane and Morvaldo sat near Rakash at the deck. Chorgane asked Rakash: "So, how are you today?"
     "Fine. I didn't thank you for your hospitality last night…" He looked into Chorgane eyes for a slight glance "…so thank you, Chorgane. You know…" He added a poor smile "… it's my first glass and I already lost interest in finishing it up, although it's a good ale, as you can see my friend Bartak and the dwarf celebrating it – all the barrel was cleaned dry by them."
     "No problem, and I am familiar with this feeling of yours." Chorgane claimed and turned to these fellows: "Bartak, Razelot, what happened to you two? Who's in charge here?" 
     Bartak answered with a dizzy expression on his face, towards the 'general' direction of Chorgane: "Not me, that's for sure… We'll stay here… tonight… you can ask Razelot… maybe I have double vision but you're sitting next to one or two elves?"
     "Jayko is in charge… yep, only one elf… Do you want a drink?" Razelot answered Bartak and then offered Morvaldo.
     "No thanks, I don't want a dwarf to pour me my drink." Morvaldo answered.
     "Good, more will remain for me…" laughing all the time "…and I wouldn't serve an elf anyway." The witchdoctor could continue this endlessly but sometimes it's better not to upset a drunken dwarf. 
     Now Chorgane managed to speak a word or two with Jayko: "You'll need a proof that I received the scrolls, so here it is." He handed a reply message for Lord Thormax to Jayko. 
     "We'll stay here for tonight and then continue to Mino-To-Kochang in the north and later on to Gardan or to Sandports."
     "That's nice. I'm going with the witchdoctor to Markash to prepare myself for a journey to Solatra."
     "Yes, an interesting place, much more than this old man's stories, he was a famous war hero a long time ago but he claims that he had forgotten his name." 
     "Yes the ale of this place has such an effect on some elderly chaps." Chorgane added.
     Jayko put out a small sack of gold coins and said: "Here's the money that Dartoff took from you and payment for the bucket he sold for three gold pieces."
     "Thanks. Where's my wife and son?"
     "They were supposed to be here an hour ago."
     "Probably still at the bartender and his wife room, room number… Oh there they are." Sheyrad holding Puritarus showed up. 
     "You can go quietly I'll manage here just fine." She kissed him a short and then a long kiss, then he kissed Puritarus and then she kissed Puritarus too - So much insignificantly details in one sentence…
     Following her was the bartender. He went to the rear side of the deck, took the glasses of wine from Bartak and Razelot and told them: "You'll pay for this barrel, fellows, but at least you had enough."
     Razelot was lying on his back and his head was supported by the wooden wall behind the deck, his belly was all puffed and he said: "I would open another barrel of this good ale if only I could reach my sword…" Looking up towards the bartender – "…Oops it's the bartender, Bartak, pretend to be sleeping…"
     He did not notice that Bartak was laid on the deck already fast asleep and snoring quite loudly.
     "Oh, here's our bartender!!!" Chorgane cried out.
     "You don't remember my name, Chorgane, my friend."
     "Cut it out with your complaints, nobody remember your name." Morvaldo mentioned – kiddingly I hope. 
     "You can give me a clue, something with A and D, right?"
     "I'll never tell you as a punishment, for not remembering my name, and for bringing this elf, they're the worst customers."
     "Especially when the bartender is a dwarf, no less…" Rakash mentioned aloud. Elves' hearing is sharp – he sat two seats away from them and take in consideration all the loud commotion. The dwarf restrained himself and said nothing.
     "Yes, that's the right spirit…" Morvaldo told Rakash, "…and your inn stinks." He added.
     "Why don't you write it on my sign outside?"
     "I wanted to, but Chorgane claimed we couldn't use your services if we do that, I could refresh this place using magic but I'll need my emergency mana for other disasters."
     "Yes, we need fresh supply of fruits for four days and our horses from the stables, now if you may." Chorgane added in the same strain of innocence.
     "Very good, anything to get you out of here, you take 'Hornet' (Chorgane's horse), and you take 'Vitary' (Morvaldo's horse, of course)." Then they all went out to his stables, paid for his services and for the supply and hit the road towards Markash.

     They rode with their horses to Markash safely. In the night after the first riding day, they stopped and made a small camp and had a good night sleep when oneself slept while the other guarded the camp. Chorgane guarded first and Morvaldo replaced him a couple of hours after midnight. They saw no one, but they felt like they are being followed.

     In the market Chorgane bought good arrows to hunt in the forest woods some good meat. Morvaldo noticed an armoury shop near the blacksmith of Markash, and took Chorgane to check their merchandise. They entered, greeted politely the orcish owner of the armoury. Chorgane looked upon some swords that laid on a wooden shelf and picked some of them for a closer examine. He showed Morvaldo how well he can swing swords in one hand and showed him how lousy these bronze swords compared to his heavy iron made sword.
     "Nothing to be compared to heavy mithril swords of elves, or mithril blade of a dwarvish axes." Morvaldo claimed.
     "Buy one of my great armours or get the hell out of this armoury, you have frightened most of my customers, not to mention myself, with this swinging of swords, barbarian!!!" Chorgane lost his smile when he heard that remark of the old orcish merchant. He turned over him, pulled a small axe from the shelf and threw it on the wall behind the merchant – he almost cracked open the skull of the merchant. The last two customers, besides Chorgane and Morvaldo, escaped from the shop.
     "You would better watch your mouth because three years ago I had eaten orcish like yourself for breakfast. Now bring me a grindstone and make haste!!!"
     "Orcish what?! You said orcish, not orcs, Chorgane." Morvaldo wondered a little bit curiously. 
     "I meant orcish guards, sorry." The orcish merchant ran quickly to bring a grindstone. After the axe was thrown, his attitude was completely changed. They turned to look upon the armours.
     "I like this fine chain mail." Morvaldo mentioned.
     "It can be easily broken by a good mithril sword in one strike, but this full plate mail is too heavy and overprotecting." Chorgane added his opinion. "How much do they cost?" Chorgane asked the orcish merchant.
     "Two thousand for the chain mail armour and five thousand gold coins for the full plate mail armour."
     "I can arrange enough money for the chain mail but it doesn't worth it. The full plate mail is too heavy and clumsy for me, at the moment. Tell your blacksmith to make me a combination of the two, tell him it's for Chorgane of Tenkai village, and I will pay him 3,000-4,000 gold coins, depends on the quality of his work and which materials the armour will be consisted from. I'll come to take it about two – four months, understood?" Chorgane verified that the orcish merchant comprehended. 
     "I will tell him, and it supposes to be ten gold coins for the grindstone…" Morvaldo coughed to imply to Chorgane that the merchant is trying to fool him, taking the clue – both Chorgane and the orcish merchant.
     "… but I will give it to you for only five."
     "Everywhere it's five – my friend, by the way, what's your name?" Morvaldo inquired.
     "Daltar." Chorgane gave him the money and bid him farewell. He told them the same.

     On the second night on the way home, Morvaldo guarded first and saw nothing of importance, except the fact that it was a moonless night. The flames of the fire they ignited earlier were quite dimmed already. Morvaldo awakened Chorgane to replace him a couple of hours after midnight. Chorgane lit a small torch and watched his elven friend falling to sleep. After an hour the light of the torch dimmed too. Another hour passed and he heard quiet footsteps approaching, he saw five figures in the darkness, and he pretended to be asleep. 
     "First kill the sleeping guard who leans on the pine tree and then his friend, search for money or valuables on the corpses and we'll get back to the camp." Said one of the beings. That figure spoke in orcish but luckily for Chorgane he knew their tongue. He silently kicked Morvaldo and awakened him. Now they were scattered, two of them approached Chorgane with daggers in their hand, they walked behind the pine tree, while two others moved toward Morvaldo, more carelessly. 
     Then all of a sudden Chorgane drew his iron sword out of the scabbard very quickly and charged on the two figures who were about to kill him, he slashed his sword through the guts of one of them and then he chopped the other one's head off, while Morvaldo took his staff and dealt with his attackers. He swung his staff and made the first foe to fall, and gave him another blow in the head which knocked him down, then he managed to hit the hand who held the knife of the second assailant. Then Chorgane came and choked that figure and went for the farther figure and choked him too with his other hand and told Morvaldo: "We need light, my friend." Morvaldo took out of a small bag three blue mana cubes, went over the woods which burnt earlier, broke the cubes of mana and chanted:
     "In order to lighten up the night,
     I order the fire to ignite!!!"
The woods were suddenly once again ignited and burned to give them light. Now they saw that they were attacked by a group of orcs, Morvaldo gave Chorgane their rope to hold the three orcs that were still alive to the pine tree that Chorgane leaned over when guarded.
     "We'll free you in the morning, if we would have a good mood." Chorgane told them.
     The orcish leader said: "We need your gold to survive, human; Lord Raymond's army banished us from our lands and villages on his territories."
     "Then you should have gone to Mino-To-Kochang, instead of robbing and killing travelers on the roads."
     "We would have done so if we had the money for transportation."

     In the morning, after Chorgane and Morvaldo were set up and ready to go, Chorgane took all their knives and daggers. He cut off his money bag and threw it on the direction leading back to Markash and told the orcs: "Take my money, it's about one hundred gold coins, use it to get the transportation you need to get to Mino-To-Kochang. Your daggers will remain in our possession for security reasons." He cut the ropes, gave them to Morvaldo and mounted his horse.
     "Farewell human." Chorgane and Morvaldo continued their journey towards their home.
     One of the orcs asked the leader: "What shall we do with the money that warrior left us?"
     "This damned warrior killed two of us, maybe we listen to his advice and maybe we'll buy new weapons with it, I'll decide later." The idea of revenge crossed his mind but the beast was now too terrified for his own life to risk them in a vengeful quest against the human warrior who killed two of his brethren. Therefore he decided to abandon the idea of revenge for another time.

     After another week has passed, Chorgane went to the 'stinking inn' and bought supplies to travel to Solatra, and took his horse, "Hornet" of the stables of the inn. He traveled quite safely to Solatra, except one short battle with forty-two goblins that decided he conquered their cave by "marking" a nearby tree; he killed four of them with a single slash of his sword. They had surrender to him immediately afterwards. 
     Chorgane arrived to Solatra and to Nockdaros' residence on time. He left Hornet in the little stables of Nockdaros' to rest and then he was greeted by Nockdaros' daughter – Nemetris. She showed him the way to the dining room and served him food that her mother cooked. Nemetris was a twelve year old girl, she was quite cute and adorable brunette little brat. She was dressed in nice and neaten simple peasant clothes like the majority of people of this land. Her mother joined them a bit after the food was served by Nemetris. She had a darker hair than Nemetris. 
     "I heard a son was born to you, Chorgane, how's Sheyrad doing so far?"
     "She's doing great, thank you. It's amazing how you knew about it, before my best friend, Jayko, Mairinda!?" 
     "Oh, shut up and eat your soup before it will get cold!!!"
     "Yes, ma'am."
     "Father said it was a small part of his vision, before several nights."
     "His name is Puritarus." Chorgane mentioned and quickly returned to the soup, in order not to upset Mairinda.
     "What a beautiful name!!!" Nemetris had to remark, and her mother nodded in approval and as a warning about the decreasing temperature of the child's soup.
     "Thank you, Nemetris. Hey, I brought you something from Tenkai." He finished the last glimpse of his soup, and drew his sword, put it on the table. "It's not the sword, don't worry Mairinda." She had a terrified expression on her face for an instance, although Nemetris felt thrilled of anticipation. Then Chorgane took off his scabbard from his belt, flipped it over and a small white pearl fell out of it, a little bit cracked. It had two small holes which Chorgane pulled a string through them and gave it to Nemetris.
     "It is beautiful, Chorgane, thank you very much!!!" Nemetris cried out excitedly.
     "As long as it's not your sword…" Mairinda sighed in relief. 
     "It is a white pearl I bought from a merchant in my village of Tenkai. It is because I haven't seen you, Nemetris, for a long time since your ninth birthday."
     "Mother, you were right, you knew that uncle Chorgane will bring me a gift, maybe you are beginning to have visions like father has!!!"
     Nockdaros was known in the area of Solatra because he was a powerful wizard who always helped peasants and the defenseless in his adventures. He also had visions and premonitions about the future which usually helped the farmers to plan ahead what to do with their crops. He made most of his money from his adventures.
     They all heard a knock on the door. Nemetris said while she was jumping off her seat: "Father came home early today as he said he would…" Chorgane held his sword in the hilt which he already put back to the scabbard, ready to draw it out and engage whoever it may be. Nemetris returned to the room excitedly, but she said nothing and started to finish finally her soup. Into the dining room entered a tall figure who had a dark blue robe with some red stripes. He had a long grey beard and when he took off his pointy hat, Chorgane could see his brownish-grey hair, which was very long. His eyes were blue in a brighter shade than his robe. He sat on the bench near Chorgane without noticing his presence.
     "Where's my dish with your soup, Mairinda?" 
     "Nemetris come with me to the kitchen right away, your father awaits his soup, and we'll bring it with the other set of dishes."
     They were a family of three so they had only two sets of three dishes each, the maximum capacity for guests besides them were three.
Nockdaros asked suddenly: "Can you pass me the bread and the butter?"
     "I thought you didn't even notice my presence, old friend."
     "How couldn't I miss your presence when your horse was parked in my horse's stable, eating his straw? To tell the truth, I was wondering when you will show your face, my dear friend."
     "Your daughter is starting to have your powers, the cute little Nemetris."
     "Perhaps she is. I'm sorry that I ignored your being there but I was too much hungry and tired of arranging the meeting tomorrow night in the spire of Soraxters the sorcerer. You will be the guest of honour there. I'm also tired of the dreams I had recently in this month, and of the vision that caused me to call upon you in the previous month."
     "It sounds a bit scary to me, for a warrior like myself to enter into a sorcerer's spire; I'll be a laughing matter to the likes of you. It is known that sorcerers despise, scorn and mock warriors' intelligence and wisdom."
     "Do not fear for your safety, the acolyte who read the book of destiny knows that your survival is necessary by any cost until your son will be able to be independent enough…"
     "Does it mean that you and that acolyte will protect me in the spire?"
     "Only if it becomes necessary, but I have a feeling it won't be."
Nemetris came back with the dish of soup for Nockdaros. Mairinda came after her. "My soup will better be on time in the future, or I'll cut your wage in half."
     "My dear Nockdaros, half of nothing is still nothing."
     "Then you should better work in the inn, then from cooking here." Nemetris showed him what Chorgane brought her from Tenkai.
     "I already knew about it, it was a part of my vision…" Chorgane was amazed at his old friend abilities for a second "…Just kidding with you, I had a feeling that you will bring her a nice gift and I was right again…" They continued to tell stories to each other. Nemetris told Chorgane many insignificant stories about her friends in school. They went to sleep at a late hour that night. 

     In the evening of tomorrow they began to walk into the northeast spire of Solatra. Chorgane was wearing a blue cloak and seemed like a wizard. He also covered his arms with a long sleeves shirt to hide his muscles from the wizards and sorcerers eyes. An hour passed and they reached the spire. The guards let them in with no trouble at all. They went into the upper chambers of the spire, and entered a small chamber of discussions, filled by eleven mages, wizards, sorcerers, acolytes, clerics, druids, necromancers, priests and magic users. All the people were silenced when Chorgane and Nockdaros entered the chamber.
     "I thought that warriors and bodyguards are not allowed to enter this chamber."
     "You are righteous as usual, Lorka the mage." Nockdaros answered. 
     "The presence of this warrior was required for your vision telling, I presume, Nockdaros." A very dark clothing figure said that in a cold voice.
     "Yes, indeed Soraxters."
     "Greetings warrior." He greeted Chorgane.
     "Greetings sorcerer." Chorgane replied.
     "He is the warrior Chorgane from the village of Tenkai. In the beginning of the previous month I started to have strange dreams and nightmares as well. One of them was a vision from the gods, sent by Corecelltor or Intimiditors or perhaps both of them. I saw there blinkers of reality and assembled pieces of other dreams into the following prophecy. Are you all prepared and ready to hear it?" Every one nodded yes and he started as follows:
     "In the night of the fire, in the circle of torches,
     The fire will confront its contradicted force which gives life,
     And the evil powers shall be transferred partially to a carrier creature,
     Which will be teleported for his exiled isolation."

     "It will occur in the next annual convention of magic-users, the location is unknown at the moment but it will become more certain in the future, but it will occur in less than a moon year from now." Nockdaros concluded his words.
     Soraxters thought for a moment and said: "You can expect us all to be present in that night and each of us will be accompanied with one warrior that will serve as a bodyguard. The warrior can be a friend or a mercenary, in any case, it doesn't matter, even if some of us don't need a bodyguard, we still keep this term of mutual agreement. By the way, Nockdaros, I have a feeling that your prophecy also determined its location according to that warrior's origin. Something tells me it will occur near Tenkai village."

     Five months later Chorgane departed for Markash. He went into that armoury shop of Daltar. His armour was ready. It was a plate mail which was consisted of many small plates of iron square tablets connected one to the other by small chains. The chains of that sort are usually used for ring or chain mail. He purchased the armour for four thousand gold coins from Daltar. The orcish merchant tried to squeeze out of Chorgane's wallet another five hundred extra gold coins, but Chorgane recognized the false attempts of Daltar to haggle for an unfair price.

     Two and a half months afterwards, Chorgane reached to the camp of Lord Thormax army in the city of Mino-To-Kochang. He was shown the way into the tent of Lord Thormax office.
     "Greetings Lord Thormax, I am Chorgane of Tenkai village."
     "So we meet at last, the legendary warrior who I'm hearing about all the time. I presume you got my letter from Jayko. He's a good soldier. So we both know what's at the stakes. Are you here to take your place beside me on the battlefield? I already have fifty thousand warriors and more are joining my forces everyday. The empire is about to be disintegrated shortly when king Utoriator will order us to strike. Myself, Lord Forenator, Lord Raymond and Lord Kelebrian are about to assist him against the emperor. Lord Teroxadors is the only one who chose to remain neutral."
     "Actually I came here, all the way from Tenkai, to tell you I must decline your proposal. I want to lead an army and continue in a combat service but I cannot neglect my family aside. I have been married for the past three and a half years and a new born son."
     "What are their names?"
     "Sheyrad is my wife and Puritarus is my son. He's only six moon months old. There's a good friend of mine who recently left the imperial guards, perhaps he'll be interested in the post you're offering."
     "What's his name and where can I find him?"
     "He's found in the town of Oaktiburg on the route to Solatra. His name is Dakard. Perhaps he'll answer your call for arms."
     "Let's hope so, it's too much a headache source for me. I understand, Chorgane, maybe you'll take your place beside me in the future. I bid you goodbye and farewell."
     "Farewell Lord Thormax."

     It took for Chorgane another two and a half months to return home to Tenkai village. Another moon month passed, it was Puritarus birthday. This time the celebration was conducted in a much smaller circle. Chorgane had to miss Puritarus' birthday, because he had to serve as a bodyguard to Nockdaros in the annual meeting of magic-users. They celebrated Puritarus' birthday a week earlier, only Chorgane, Sheyrad, Morvaldo, Talas, Velra and their daughter Renara who were just three weeks younger than Puritarus – were the attendants of the party. Actually there were a few other attendants but that was really a close circle party in comparison to last year celebration.

     This year the annual meeting of magic-users took place just a little bit north-west to Tenkai village. The meeting's location was set between the gold mine of the humans near the hills of Tilla-Jawb and the horticultural fields north of Tenkai.

     On the day of the meeting, Flamenor awaken a dragon in their isolated secret isle. The island was located a bit to the south west of the continent of Mino-To-Kochang. "Good morning, Forkored."
     "Is it time, yet? I only had a year nap…"
     "Stop complaining about your short slumber, mine was shorter, we got work to do tonight. There is havoc and mayhem to be unleashed in that continent, and some forests which need a bit of ignition."
     "Well it is the night of fire, isn't it?" They laughed for a while.
     "How did you hear about the prophecy, I thought you were busy sleeping?"
     "I told you it was only a nap, I heard a few of my brethren speaking about it during my sleep."
     Afterward Flamenor mounted the back of Forkored and they ascended into their little scheme in the direction of Tenkai village.

     The meeting already began in the evening of that night. All the bodyguards also served as squires to the magic-users and they carried their torches to light their surroundings. The meeting started quite calmly like it is carried out every year. The leader of each alignment spoke his words, then it was the priests, clerics and acolytes turn to speak. 
     Exactly after the cleric of Flamenor spoke his words of gratitude for the gift of fire, both Forkored and his rider Flamenor reached out from the direction of the hills of Tilla-Jawb. They had ignited each and every tree of the forest that surrounded the hills and the meeting place, which took place in a glade of the woods. Forkored used his rapid fire breath and Flamenor had the same effect with his fireballs. When Hydrotilis noticed this from the Temple of Clouds, he immediately alerted the other gods to the situation and teleported himself to the ocean north of the continent.
     He got out of the water as quickly as he could, riding on his water worm. He chased both Flamenor and Forkored, while on his way he put out the blazes where he and his worm have passed.

     Many priests and acolytes prayed for Windtilis to bring rain clouds, and to Rainveil to allow them to pour their waters on the flames. Sometime later the sky was filled with rain clouds from the west that started to pour their water on the burning woods. Lighturos also joined the party with his lightning bolts who managed to ignite some of the lumber it hit.

     Three other gods reached to the arena as well – Corecelltor, Partogmidis and Intimiditors. The latter one drew his battleaxe all of a sudden and managed to cut off one of the arms of Corecelltor. Luring his attention was Lin-Aris who called him, while Partogmidis was the one who rescued him from getting that strike into his skull.
     "So much predictable, I knew I couldn't kill any of you, if I had a true chance, then the guardians of fate would be here to stop me. Still, hurting you was just as good for me, not to mention most enjoyable – all the same." Intimiditors tried to tease Corecelltor. "Well, it's your move now, will you do something to restore the balance of souls, Corecelltor?"
The battleaxe of Intimiditors morphed into a scythe. From some strange reason he dropped it and the scythe was broken into many small ravens which started to glide down to the earth. Half the way into their descent all the ravens morphed into white pigeons. The pigeons ascended and came to Corecelltor, when they reached his healthy arm they were combined and morphed into a halberd.
     "This is exactly what I came here to do, Intimiditors, now behold and see the prophecy of Nockdaros come to life." He started to chant various words of spell in different languages, then swarms of energies from every soul of an evil entity, both flesh and god, were centered in front of Corecelltor. He controlled the pillar of energy with his telepathy alone, though it seemed he was channeling the flow of energy through the halberd. Then the halberd was broken into many small flames which were reassembled as a phoenix. The phoenix then assimilated the energy pillar. Partogmidis used the teleport spell to open a rift and the phoenix flew from it and into it.
     "There's your balance. This is your punishment for creating three pure evil souls and whining on one pure good-nature soul…" He paused and patted the stump that Intimiditors created. "…And for cutting my arm today. That will be known as the Phoenix of Antarctica – the last guardian of souls. Inside the phoenix are the essences of half the evil souls of this world. They will be kept in that isolated land of ice glaciers and the only mortal who will be able to free her from her cryogenic prison of ice will be Puritarus, son of Chorgane and Sheyrad. Consult the book of destiny if you wish to do so, it matters not. Any mortal that will attempt to free her will be killed by the guardian angels of fate. Please do remember that we also become mortals in this realm, so don't try to send one of your immortal gods in this quest either. Your only chance now is co-operation with my side."
     "This is not over, Corecelltor, today you might have won, but you will pay highly for your actions this day. So many souls you have condemned this day, to fall into the bottomless abyss, souls from both sides. There will come a day when you will realize your mistake but that day is far from today, so I will allow you to enjoy this fading moment of victory, till I see you past the gates of oblivion, down in the abyss. Perhaps then you will understand the consequence to your actions this day. Farewell, Corecelltor."

     Thus the Phoenix of Antarctica was created.

* * *

     Talas managed later to forge a sword from the bone of Corecelltor's arm. Chorgane bought it from him. Puritarus grew to be a fine boy, and Chorgane taught him everything he knew, mostly how to fight and defend oneself. Puritarus passed his knowledge to some of his friends and to Renara. She was his best friend, and the only girl in Tenkai village who liked him anyway. Another good friend of them was Palor, who was the son of an orcish merchant who Talas and Chorgane used to make business with.

     End of chapter one – The Creation.
